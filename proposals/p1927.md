## Problem

Slices of arrays is a popular way to extract subarray of array. They also may
be used for generating arrays.

## Background

There is no requirements for background.

## Proposal

Introduce slice generators.

## Details

Slice syntax is `a:b:s`. Here, `a` is the beginning of slice, `b` is the end of
slice and `s` is the step in slice. In array indexing, `:s` can be omitted, then
it means that step is 1. If `a` is omitted, slice starts from the beginning of
array. The same situation is for `b`, but slice ends at the end of arrays. `:`
is the same as `::`. If `s` is negative, lower and upper bounds are replaces
each other.

Slice generator may return `i32`, `i64`, `i128` and unsigned versions of them.

Slice as generator of array:
```carbon
  var array: auto = (1:5:2); // array = (1,3,5)
  var arrav: auto = 1:5:2; // arrav = (1,3,5)
```
Round brackets may be omitted.

In operator `[]` of array, slices can be used in the following ways:
```
  var array: auto = (1:5:2); // array = (1,3,5)
  var a1: auto = array[:]; // a1 = (1,3,5)
  var a2: auto = array[::]; // a2 = (1,3,5)
  var a3: auto = array[:1]; // a3 = (1,3)
  var a4: auto = array[::-1]; // a4 = (5,3,1)
  var a5: auto = array[:2:-1]; // a5 = (5)
```

Note, `auto` for slice of one element gives an array containing one element.

## Rationale

It has an effect to [Code that is easy to read, understand, and write](/docs/project/goals.md#code-that-is-easy-to-read-understand-and-write).

## Alternatives considered

Most of programming languages have syntax the same or close to proposed.

In Pascal, [subrange](https://wiki.freepascal.org/subrange_types) is available.
Using similar syntax, slice may produce arrays:
```carbon
  var arr: auto = 1 .. 4;
```
will generate `[1, 2, 3, 4]` (round brackets may be omitted). Unfortunately,
such syntax does not allow generate array with specific step between elements.

Another way is function call. The most simple and can be implemented via
standard library.
```carbon
  var arr: auto = slice(/*low=*/ 1, /*high=*/ 4, /*step=*/ 1);
```
Here, `step` is optional argument. This way lacks possibility to specify only
low or high bounds or even skip both of them.
It will lead to the following code for slicing of whole array that is not simple
to read, understand, and write:
```carbon
  var arr: auto = (1, 2, 3);
  var arr_copy: auto = arr[slice(lbound(arr), ubound(arr))];
```
`lbound` and `ubound` returns lower and upper bounds of `arr`, respectively.
